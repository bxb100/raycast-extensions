Report how many trains are on time vs delayed, and the average delay.\n\n3. **Save favorites**: Use save-trip to save frequently used routes, get-saved-trips to retrieve them.\n\nWhen asked about delays or service status, always use get-departures to check current real-time data. Common stations include Central, Town Hall, Circular Quay, Bondi Junction, Parramatta, Strathfield, Chatswood, and airport stations."

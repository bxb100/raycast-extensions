# OpenCode Sessions

Browse, search, and manage your [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) sessions.

View full transcripts, generate summaries, and manage session data directly from Raycast.

## Features

- Browse all sessions with time-grouped sections (Today, Yesterday, This Week, etc.)
- Filter sessions by project
- View full conversation transcripts with tool usage details
- Generate AI-powered session summaries
- Copy transcripts, session IDs, slugs, and resume commands

## Configuration

By default, the extension reads session data from `~/.local/share/opencode/storage`.
You can override this path in the extension preferences if your OpenCode data is stored
elsewhere.

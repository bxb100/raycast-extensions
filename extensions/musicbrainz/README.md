# MusicBrainz

Search [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org) for artists, releases, recordings, 
release groups, labels, and works. View detailed information including discographies, 
tracklists, cover art, and Wikipedia summaries. Quickly copy MBIDs and other identifiers.
Lookup an entity by pasting a MusicBrainz URL or MBID.

## Features

- Search across all major MusicBrainz entity types
- View detailed information with metadata, relationships, and Wikipedia extracts
- Cover art display for releases and release groups
- Direct lookup by pasting a MusicBrainz URL or MBID
- Copy MBIDs, ISRCs, ISNIs, IPIs, ISWCs, and MusicBrainz URLs
- Navigate to related entities via the action panel (e.g. artist to release group to release)

## Direct Lookup

You can paste a MusicBrainz URL or bare MBID directly into the search bar:

- `https://musicbrainz.org/artist/0743b15a-3c32-48c8-ad58-cb325350befa`
- `0743b15a-3c32-48c8-ad58-cb325350befa`

When a URL is pasted, the entity type is inferred from the URL. For a bare MBID, 
the extension will resolve the entity type automatically.
